  <p>That's it! I hope you enjoyed veiwing this webpage, and sadly that's it for the time being. If u want more, check out the link at the top for my other website, or you can wait for more. (My next pictures will be in a visit to China to see my kin, but sadly COVID-19 is on the loose, so I cant enjoy my trip. Also, I only go to China in the summer, where there's no school for two months.) </p>
